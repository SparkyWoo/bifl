| YOREPEK Travel Backpack | $ | $38 | A cavernous 50L pack made of heavy-duty polyester and robust stitching.

| Targus Legend IQ Backpack | $ | $30 | A value-priced laptop backpack with features and build quality beyond its price.

The London Roll Top also features excellent hardware (strong buckles, zippers, and a waterproof roll-top closure) that are built to last.
