I'll compile a list of durable, high-quality TV speakers across all types, including soundbars, bookshelf speakers, home theater systems, and surround sound setups. The focus will be on longevity, audio quality, and repairability where applicable. I'll verify all Amazon links for functionality and ensure they contain the 'buywhoa-20' referral tag. I'll update you once the list is ready.
